Materials and textures are related concepts in the field of computer graphics, 3D modeling, and rendering, but they serve different purposes.

Materials: A material is a set of properties and attributes that define the appearance and interaction of a surface with light. It determines how an object will look when rendered, including color, reflectivity, transparency, roughness, and other optical qualities. Materials are composed of various components called shaders, which are mathematical algorithms that calculate the behavior of light when it interacts with the object's surface.

Textures: A texture is a 2D image or pattern that is mapped onto the surface of a 3D object to provide additional visual detail. Textures can be photographs, procedural patterns, or hand-painted images, and they are used to add realism, detail, and complexity to a model's surface. Textures can represent various surface properties, such as color (diffuse), reflectivity (specular), bumpiness (normal/displacement), roughness, and more.

In summary, materials define the overall appearance and properties of an object's surface, while textures add fine details and surface variations by mapping 2D images onto the object. Both materials and textures work together to create realistic and visually appealing 3D models in computer graphics.
